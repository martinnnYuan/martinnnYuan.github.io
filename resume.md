# Summary

I'm a Geography (Data Science) student at the University of Washington who builds data-driven tools for real social impact. My recent work blends GeoAI, humanistic GIS, and app development, A SwiftUI + Firebase mindfulness app that connects spatial perception with well-being, and a GeoAI framework (LLMs such as Gemini + SAM + cartography) to identify food deserts and inform equitable policy. I've analyzed climate and wildfire risk (R, QGIS), constructed and queried real-world databases for product insights (SQL), and delivered industry research during a data analytics internship. I enjoy turning messy spatial data into clear maps, models, and decisions, and I'm excited about roles at the intersection of GeoAI, urban/environmental analytics, and product data. Let's connect if you're working on city dynamics, sustainability, or health outcomes powered by spatial data.
